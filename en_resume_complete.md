## üéØ&nbsp;Cloud Developer

> For more than ten years, first as a Full-Stack Software Engineer then as a Technical Lead and finally as Solutions
> Architect, I was able to learn about various functional domains (healthcare, banking/insurance...) while working with
> multiple technologies (Java, Angular, Node.js, Unix...).<br />
> In order to widen my skills around the lifecycle of application software, I took a position oriented around
> infrastructures in the Cloud, that I now wish to validate on other missions.
